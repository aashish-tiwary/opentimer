# OpenTimer
OpenTimer is a new static timing analysis (STA) tool to help IC designers quickly verify the circuit timing. It is developed completely from the ground up using C++17 to efficiently support parallel and incremental timing.
Key features are:
* Industry standard format (.lib, .v, .spef, .sdc) support
* Graph- and path-based timing analysis
* Parallel incremental timing for fast timing closure
* Award-winning tools and golden timers in CAD Contests
# Compile OpenTimer
## System Requirements
OpenTimer is very self-contained and has very few dependencies. 
To compile OpenTimer, you need a C++17 compiler and currently support:

* GNU C++ Compiler v7.3 with -std=c++1z
* Clang C++ Compiler v6.0 with -std=c++17
In addition, you need a tcl shell interpreter:
* tclsh (most Unix/Linux/OSX distributions already include tclsh)
OpenTimer has been tested to run well on Linux distributions and MAC OSX.
## Build through CMake
We use CMake to manage the source and tests. We recommend using out-of-source build.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/OpenTimer/OpenTimer.git
$ cd OpenTimer
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ apt install cmake --classic (If it shows that cmake is not installed already)
$ make 
```
After successful build, you can find binaries and libraries in the folders ```bin and lib```, respectively.
## Run Tests
OpenTimer uses Doctest for unit tests and TAU15 benchmarks for integration/regression tests. These benchmarks are generated by an industry standard timer and are being used by many EDA researchers.
```
$ make test
```
# Get Started with OpenTimer
```
$ ./bin/ot-shell
```
